# Design of a RISC-V-lite processor
The main purpose of this lab was to design in VHDL a RISC-V-lite processor with 5 pipeline stages where the instructions supported by this processor are a subset of the whole RV32I which has a 32-bit fixed-width instruction set. 
In particular, this subset is defined by the instructions required to execute the "minv" application given as specification.
